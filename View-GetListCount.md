As you can see, in order to do this you  define a new field followed by colon `:` and then follow the regular view
definition with a one tab indent. Thus nested view follows the same definition syntax. Of course, you can also
define third and fourth layers in the same manner, with each next layer having one more tab indent.

## Joins
**#TODO** Nested vs joins. How view depends on API.

While the regular nested views are usually used for put api
